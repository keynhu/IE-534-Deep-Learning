\maketitle

This homework asks to finish the following tasks:\\
1. Classify videos from UCF101 datasets with a random frame from each, trained with ResNet-50;\\
2. Classify videos from UCF101 datasets with a bunch of continuous frames (16 in our case), trained with ResNet-101 (3-dimension form).\\

\section{Hyperparameter Settings and Time Cost}
For the first training without Generator, the process runs 51 epochs in total, costing 118 minutes. ADAM is applied during training, and the original learning rate is given as 1e-4. \\
Input images are shuffled, then divided into mini batches, with batch size as 128. Several types of data augmentation are implemented on train set, including random horizontal flip, random resized crop, random color jitter and normalization with mean 0.5 and sd 0.5 on all channels. Center crop and normalization is also implemented on the test set.\\
\\
For the second training with Generator, the training process runs 200 epochs in total, costing 46 hours and 51 minutes. ADAM is applied during training, and the original learning rate is given as 1e-4.\\
Input images are shuffled, then divided into mini batches, with batch size as 100. Several types of data augmentation are implemented on train set, exactly the same as the first training process. Center crop and normalization is also implemented on the test set.\\

\section{Accuracy}
For the first part, accuracy of top-1 is 0.785884; accuracy of top-5 is 0.936558; accuracy of top-10 is 0.966957.\\
For the second part, accuracy of top-1 is 0.830029; accuracy of top-5 is 0.959820; accuracy of top-10 is 0.966957.

\section{Result Evaluation}
\subsection{Best and worst classes}
For the first part, the best classes that are all classified correctly are:\\
\emph{'BasketballDunk', 'Billiards', 'Bowling', 'BreastStroke', 'Diving', 'FloorGymnastics', 'HorseRace', 'HorseRiding', 'MilitaryParade', 'PlayingDaf', 'PlayingTabla', 'PoleVault', 'RockClimbingIndoor', 'Rowing', 'Skijet', 'SkyDiving', 'SoccerPenalty', 'SumoWrestling', 'Surfing', 'WritingOnBoard'.}\\
The worst 10 classes are:\\
\emph{'JumpRope', 'HandstandWalking', 'YoYo', 'Nunchucks', 'BodyWeightSquats', 'HighJump', 'FrontCrawl', 'PullUps', 'WallPushups', 'Lunges'.}\\

As for the second part, the best classes that are all classified correctly are:\\
\emph{'BabyCrawling', 'BalanceBeam', 'BasketballDunk', 'Billiards', 'Bowling', 'BoxingSpeedBag', 'Fencing', 'FloorGymnastics', 'HorseRace', 'HorseRiding', 'JumpingJack', 'Knitting', 'PlayingDhol', 'PlayingGuitar', 'PlayingPiano', 'PlayingTabla', 'PoleVault', 'RockClimbingIndoor', 'Skijet', 'SoccerPenalty', 'StillRings', 'VolleyballSpiking', 'WallPushups'.}\\
The worst 10 classes are:\\
\emph{'Nunchucks', 'Lunges', 'JavelinThrow', 'YoYo', 'Shotput', 'HandstandWalking', 'MoppingFloor', 'SoccerJuggling', 'PizzaTossing', 'HighJump'.}\\

(Compare similarities/differences? )
As I observe, there are 20 classes best classified by the first model, and 23 by the second model. This implies that the second model works a bit better than the first model in UCF101 dataset.\\
In addition, among the two lists of best classes, there are in total 11 classes are best classified by both parts. This implies that both temporal and spatial information about these classes are properly classified.\\
\emph{'BasketballDunk', 'Billiards', 'Bowling', 'FloorGymnastics', 'HorseRace', 'HorseRiding', 'PlayingTabla', 'PoleVault', 'RockClimbingIndoor', 'Skijet', 'SoccerPenalty'.}\\

The classes that are best classified by the first model, but not the second:\\
\emph{'BreastStroke', 'Diving', 'MilitaryParade', 'PlayingDaf', 'Rowing', 'SkyDiving', 'SumoWrestling', 'Surfing', 'WritingOnBoard',}\\
which means these classes are discriminated by their temporal information.\\

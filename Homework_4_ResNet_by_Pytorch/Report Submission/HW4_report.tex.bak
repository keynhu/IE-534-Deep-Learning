\section{Hyperparameter Settings and Time Cost}
For the first Neural Network
This Deep CNN has done two types of data augmentation, i.e. random vertical flip, as well as random center crop.\\
Input images are shuffled, then divided into mini batches, with batch size as 100.\\
The training process runs 100 epochs in total. The original learning rate is given as 1e-4, but then adjusted with ADAM during training.\\
In total, it costs around 67 minutes to train the network.

This homework asks us to train two networks, i.e. Residual Network (ResNet) specified in the homework sheet, as well as tuning a pretrained ResNet-18 on CIFAR 100.

\section{Hyperparameter Settings and Time Cost}
For the first ResNet, the training process runs 50 epochs in total, costing 101 minutes. ADAM is applied during training, and the original learning rate is given as 1e-3. In addition, dropout rate is set as 0.2. \\
Input images are shuffled, then divided into mini batches, with batch size as 128. Two types of data augmentation are implemented: Random horizontal flip and random center crop with 32$\times$32 and padding 4.\\
\\
For the second ResNet, the training process runs 23 epochs in total, costing 5 hours and 55 minutes. ADAM is applied during training, and the original learning rate is given as 1e-5.\\
Input images are shuffled, then divided into mini batches, with batch size as 100. Four types of data augmentation are implemented: Resize as 224$\times$224 images, random horizontal flip, random color jitter and normalize with mean (0.485,0.456,0.406) and standard error (0.229, 0.224, 0.225).\\

\section{Accuracy Graph}
For the first ResNet, the accuracy graph is shown as Figure 1. The test accuracy achieves 60.05\% at the 31st epoch, but is then oscillating around 60\%. It seems that my code needs to be improved before it can provide a higher accuracy.\\
And for the pretrained ResNet, the accuracy graph is shown as Figure 2. The test accuracy achieves 70.26\% at the 13th epoch, and achieves 73.47\% at the 23rd epoch. Since the walltime is set as 6 hours, the algorithm is then terminated. If given more training time, this number may be able to be over 75\%.
